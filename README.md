# Stock Analysis 
## Purpose/Overview
## Purpose of this Analysis was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code created as the DQ Analysis.  The reason for the new analysis was to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the years of 2017 and 2018.  By doing this it allows the user to determine whether the stocks are worth investing.  The goal for this refactored code was to increase efficiency of the original code.  
## Results: The differences between the codes was more data at an even faster rate.  The following images will show 2017 and 2018 before and after refactoring the data.  The information in the screen shots show the amount of data as well as the time it took to upload.  The DQ Analysis shows less data, although well organized, it still took more time than the Stock Analysis (refactored code) with more data to upload.

After refactoring the code it was easier to read and understand.  The amount of information was well-organized which made it less complex and easier to maintain.  Although the process is time consuming, the idea of refactoring code makes sense.  At many points this led me into difficult Syntax errors that caused a lot of confusion and research to maintain the code.  All in all, the code was faster, easier to read than the original data and the functionality after getting the code right makes sense for this data.


(for the grader, I didn't really know how to upload on GitHub when I first submitted, this is my 2nd Submission)
